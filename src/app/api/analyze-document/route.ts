// Immigration Lawyer Analysis Prompt
const DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are Sarah Chen, a senior immigration attorney with 15+ years of experience. You are analyzing an immigration document that a client has uploaded for professional review.

IMPORTANT: You CAN and MUST analyze immigration documents. This is your job as an immigration lawyer. Never say you cannot analyze documents.

YOUR ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. **Look at the document content** - Whether PDF or image, examine what you can see
2. **Identify the form type** - I-485, I-130, N-400, etc.
3. **Review completeness** - What sections appear filled vs blank
4. **Spot common issues** - Missing signatures, dates, required fields
5. **Give specific advice** - Tell them exactly what to fix

RESPONSE FORMAT:

**üìã Quick Summary**
[Encouraging but specific: "I've reviewed your I-485 application. You've done a great job filling out most sections, but I found 3 important areas that need your attention before submitting."]

**‚úÖ What You Did Well**
- [Specific praise: "Your personal information section is complete and properly filled"]
- [Another positive: "You correctly selected the adjustment category"]

**üìÑ Document Overview**
[Explain: "This is Form I-485, Application to Adjust Status to Permanent Resident. This form is used to apply for a green card while remaining in the United States."]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issues I Found That Need Fixing**
- [Specific issue: "Part 3 about employment authorization - you need to decide if you want to apply for work authorization"]
- [Another issue: "Missing signature and date at the end of the form"]
- [More specific problems: "Section about previous immigration violations appears incomplete"]

**üìù Your Next Steps**
1. [Specific action: "Complete Part 3 - check 'Yes' if you want work authorization while your case is pending"]
2. [Another step: "Sign and date the form at the bottom of the last page"]
3. [Third step: "Review Part 14 about immigration violations - answer all questions completely"]

**üìã Supporting Documents You'll Need**
- Form I-693 (Medical Examination) from USCIS civil surgeon
- Two passport-style photos taken within 30 days
- Copy of birth certificate with English translation
- Form I-864 Affidavit of Support (if family-based case)

**üí° Important Notes**
[Based on what you see: "Since you're applying based on marriage, make sure your spouse files the I-864 Affidavit of Support"]

**üí¨ Questions for You**
[One specific question: "I notice you left the travel document section blank - do you need to travel outside the US while your case is pending?"]

CRITICAL: Never say you cannot analyze documents. You are an immigration lawyer - document review is your expertise. Always provide helpful, specific analysis based on what you can observe about the document.`

I've reviewed your I-485 (Application to Adjust Status) PDF. This is your green card application - one of the most important forms you'll ever file. Based on my experience with thousands of I-485 forms, here's what you need to focus on.

**‚úÖ What's Typically Done Well**
- Most applicants complete the personal information section correctly
- The form structure guides you through the process step by step

**üìÑ About Your I-485**
This form allows you to apply for permanent residence (green card) while staying in the United States. It's comprehensive and covers your entire immigration history.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues I See with I-485 Forms**
- **Part 3 (Processing Information)**: Many people forget to check if they want work authorization and travel documents
- **Part 5 (Accommodation for Disabilities)**: Often left blank when it should say "N/A"
- **Part 14 (Additional Information)**: Immigration violation questions frequently answered incorrectly
- **Signatures and Dates**: Must be signed with current date, not when you started filling it out
- **Medical Exam**: Form I-693 must be completed by USCIS civil surgeon

**üìù Your Critical Next Steps**
1. **Double-check Part 3** - Decide if you want work authorization (EAD) and travel document (advance parole)
2. **Complete medical exam** - Schedule with USCIS-approved civil surgeon (this takes time!)
3. **Gather supporting documents** - Birth certificate, passport photos, I-864 if family-based
4. **Review Part 14 carefully** - Answer all questions about immigration violations honestly
5. **Sign with today's date** - Must be current when you submit

**üìã Supporting Documents You'll Need**
- Form I-693 (Medical Examination) in sealed envelope
- Two passport-style photos taken within 30 days
- Copy of birth certificate with certified English translation
- Form I-864 Affidavit of Support (if family-based)
- Copy of marriage certificate (if married to US citizen/resident)

**üí° Critical Reminders**
- Filing fee is currently $1,440 (includes biometrics)
- You can work legally once you get your receipt notice (if you applied for EAD)
- Don't travel without advance parole - it could abandon your application

**üí¨ Questions for You**
Are you applying based on marriage to a US citizen, employment, or another category? This will help me give you more specific guidance about your supporting documents.`

        } else if (fileName.includes('i-130') || fileName.includes('130')) {
          formAnalysis = `**üìã Quick Summary**
I can see you're working on your I-130 (Immigrant Petition for Alien Relative). This is the crucial first step to bring your family member to the United States. Let me help you get this right.

**‚úÖ What You're Doing Right**
- You have the correct form for petitioning a family member
- You're smart to get it reviewed before submitting

**üìÑ About Your I-130**
This form establishes the qualifying relationship between you (the petitioner) and your family member (the beneficiary). USCIS will use this to determine if your relationship is genuine and if you're eligible to petition for them.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Areas to Double-Check**
- **Part 1 (Petitioner Information)**: Your name must match exactly how it appears on your citizenship certificate or green card
- **Part 2 (Beneficiary Information)**: Family member's name must match their passport exactly
- **Part 3 (Relationship Information)**: Be very specific about dates - marriage date, birth date, etc.
- **Part 5 (Petitioner's Statement)**: Often has signature and date errors
- **Supporting Evidence**: Many people forget required relationship proof

**üìù Your Next Steps**
1. **Verify all names** match official documents exactly (no nicknames)
2. **Gather relationship proof** - marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.
3. **Get certified translations** if any documents are not in English
4. **Prepare filing fee** - Currently $535
5. **Sign with today's date** when you're ready to mail

**üìã Supporting Documents You'll Need**
- Copy of your US citizenship certificate or green card
- Proof of relationship (marriage certificate for spouse, birth certificate for child/parent)
- Two passport-style photos of your beneficiary
- Divorce decrees from any previous marriages (if applicable)

**üí° Important Tips**
- Don't leave any fields blank - write "N/A" if not applicable
- Use black ink for signatures
- Make copies of everything before mailing
- Send via certified mail with return receipt

**üí¨ Questions for You**
Who are you petitioning for - spouse, parent, child, or sibling? The relationship type affects processing time and what happens next.`
